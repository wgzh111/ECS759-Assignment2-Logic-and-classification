This code mainly implements CNN and recognizes the clothes in the fashion mnist data set. A variety of different activation functions and learning rates were tried and compared. The hidden layer of the CNN network consists of 2 convolutional layers, 2 maximum pooling layers and 2 fully connected layers

[Function description]:
MyCNN class -- cnn model
evaluation -- Function for calculating accuracy
train_process -- Function for training the model

[Development Environment]: Running in a colab env. torchvision, torch, numpy and matplotlib are required.
